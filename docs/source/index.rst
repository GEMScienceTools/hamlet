hztest: A package for seismic hazard model testing
==================================================

``hztest`` is a Python package developed (OK, in development) for qualitative
and quantitative testing of Probabiblistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA)
models. ``hztest`` is developed by the `GEM Foundation`_, and uses the
OpenQuake_ software extensively.

.. _GEM Foundation: https://www.globalquakemodel.org
.. _OpenQuake: https://github.com/GEM/oq-engine

``hztest`` will incorporate several model test frameworks, including those
developed by GEM and some of those developed outside of GEM such as the RELM_
tests. Currently, and likely in the future, the model files will be required to
be in the OpenQuake_ format, regardless of the format of their original
implementation.
